{"id": 195, "prompt": "How do wave energy converters work?", "response": "\nWave energy converters are devices that convert the kinetic energy of ocean waves into electrical energy. They do this by using the up-and-down motion of the waves to drive a mechanical or hydraulic system, which is then used to generate electricity. There are several different types of wave energy converters, including:\n\n1. Point absorbers: These devices are attached to the sea floor and move up and down with the waves. They use a hydraulic or mechanical system to convert the movement of the device into electricity.\n2. Surface attenuators: These devices", "processing_time": 8.473053932189941}
