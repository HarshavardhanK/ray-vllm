# vLLM Batch Inference Performance Optimization Guide

Performance optimization for vLLM batch inference requires a systematic approach across multiple layers: framework configuration, CUDA-level optimizations, system architecture, and implementation best practices. Research shows that properly optimized deployments can achieve **2-24x performance improvements** while reducing memory usage by up to 55% through strategic optimization techniques.

## vLLM framework optimizations deliver foundation gains

**Optimal batch sizing represents the critical first optimization.** Configure `max_num_batched_tokens` above 8096 for throughput-focused workloads, as this enables efficient GPU utilization across mixed prefill and decode operations. The vLLM V1 architecture provides automatic continuous batching with 1.7x performance improvement over V0, making it the preferred deployment target.

**Memory configuration requires precision balancing.** Set `gpu_memory_utilization` to 0.9-0.95 to maximize available KV cache space, as PagedAttention's block-based storage reduces memory fragmentation from 60-80% waste to under 4%. This efficiency gain enables significantly larger batch sizes and higher concurrent request handling.

**Tensor parallelism scaling follows clear patterns.** Within single nodes, set `tensor_parallel_size` equal to the number of available GPUs for optimal performance. Communication overhead remains minimal due to fast NVLink interconnects, while memory benefits compound as model weights distribute across GPUs. For multi-node deployments, combine tensor parallelism within nodes with pipeline parallelism across nodes using the pattern: tensor parallel size = GPUs per node, pipeline parallel size = number of nodes.

**KV cache optimization through PagedAttention provides substantial gains.** The technology enables up to 55% memory reduction for complex sampling scenarios and supports 2.2x improvement in parallel sampling throughput. Configure block-based storage with the default 16-token block size, leveraging copy-on-write mechanisms for efficient memory sharing during beam search and parallel generation.

```python
# High-throughput production configuration
llm = LLM(
    model="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct",
    tensor_parallel_size=4,
    gpu_memory_utilization=0.95,
    max_num_batched_tokens=16384,
    max_num_seqs=512,
    max_model_len=8192,
    enable_chunked_prefill=True
)
```

## CUDA-level optimizations unlock hardware potential

**FlashAttention represents the cornerstone of attention optimization.** FlashAttention-3 achieves up to 740 TFLOPs/s on H100 GPUs through warp-specialization and asynchronous execution overlap. The implementation utilizes CUTLASS 3.x with WGMMA instructions and TMA for efficient memory transfers, delivering 1.5-2.0x speedup over FlashAttention-2. For production deployments, FlashInfer provides robust attention kernels optimized specifically for serving workloads, achieving 90% bandwidth utilization with comprehensive sparse attention support.

**Memory coalescing techniques directly impact bandwidth utilization.** Ensure consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses by carefully structuring matrix operations and utilizing shared memory for transpose operations. Modern GPUs coalesce accesses into minimal 32-byte transactions, making proper alignment to cache line boundaries crucial for optimal performance. Thread-to-data mapping must align with hardware memory architecture to avoid bandwidth penalties.

**Mixed precision quantization offers substantial memory and performance benefits.** FP8 quantization provides 2x memory bandwidth improvement over FP16 with minimal accuracy degradation, enabling larger batch sizes on memory-constrained systems. H100 and Ada Lovelace architectures offer hardware acceleration for FP8 operations, achieving up to 8.5% latency reduction. For older architectures, INT8 SmoothQuant with proper outlier handling provides good balance between performance and quality.

**CUDA streams enable computation-memory overlap.** Implement multiple streams to process different request batches simultaneously, particularly beneficial for mixed prefill and decode phases. CUDA graphs reduce CPU overhead by up to 35% for batch size 1 inference, though they work best with fixed batch sizes and sequence lengths.

```python
# Stream optimization pattern
streams = [torch.cuda.Stream() for _ in range(num_gpus)]
for i, stream in enumerate(streams):
    with torch.cuda.stream(stream):
        data_gpu = data_cpu.to(f'cuda:{i}', non_blocking=True)
        result = model_forward(data_gpu)
```

## System-level architecture determines scaling efficiency

**Multi-GPU topology requires strategic configuration.** NVLink 4.0 provides 900 GB/s bidirectional bandwidth per H100 GPU, enabling near-linear scaling up to 8 GPUs within nodes. Rail-based topologies outperform traditional spine-leaf configurations for LLM workloads, with health-score-based routing improving utilization by 15-25%. For distributed deployments, InfiniBand 400Gbps approaches PCIe Gen4 bandwidth limits, requiring PCIe Gen5 for full high-speed interconnect utilization.

**CPU-GPU data transfer optimization addresses critical bottlenecks.** PCIe 4.0 x16 delivers theoretical 64 GB/s but practical performance reaches only 20-25 GB/s, representing 60-80% of total performance bottlenecks. Implement pinned memory management using `cudaMallocManaged()` and `cudaHostAlloc()` for 2-3x transfer improvements. Configure memory pools to avoid frequent allocation overhead, typically sizing 2-4GB per GPU.

**Memory mapping and prefetching strategies extend effective capacity.** Memory-map model files directly from NVMe storage, implementing three-tier storage hierarchy: hot data on NVMe (2.5 GB/s sustained reads), warm data in RAM, cold data on network storage. L2 cache-oriented asynchronous prefetching achieves 2.15x attention kernel efficiency, while predictive prefetching based on request patterns reduces latency by 40-60%.

**Thread pool optimization balances CPU utilization.** Configure thread count to match physical CPU cores for compute-bound tasks, achieving over 90% memory bandwidth utilization with proper thread binding. NUMA-aware threading distributes workload across memory domains while preventing costly cross-socket penalties. Use `numactl` for optimal memory locality in multi-socket systems.

## Code analysis and bottleneck identification

While specific batch inference code wasn't provided, **common optimization targets follow predictable patterns.** Monitor tensor_parallel_size configuration against available GPU topology, ensuring values align with hardware capabilities. Evaluate max_num_batched_tokens and max_num_seqs settings against workload characteristics—higher values improve throughput but increase memory requirements and latency variance.

**Memory allocation strategies require systematic analysis.** Examine gpu_memory_utilization settings in context of model size and concurrent request patterns. Values below 0.85 often indicate conservative configuration leaving performance on the table, while values above 0.95 may cause instability under peak loads. Monitor KV cache preemption rates as indicators of memory pressure requiring configuration adjustment.

**Monitoring overhead assessment proves critical for production deployments.** PyTorch profiler introduces 5-10% overhead and should be disabled in production environments. Prometheus metrics collection imposes 1-2% performance impact—acceptable for production monitoring. Nsight profiling creates 10-20% overhead, limiting use to diagnostic sessions rather than continuous monitoring.

## Profiling techniques reveal performance bottlenecks

**NVIDIA Nsight Systems provides comprehensive bottleneck identification.** Use systematic profiling commands to capture detailed execution traces during representative workloads. Profile offline inference with controlled batch sizes and sequence lengths to establish baseline performance, then analyze server deployments under realistic load patterns.

```bash
# Comprehensive profiling for batch inference
nsys profile -o batch_profile.nsys-rep --trace-fork-before-exec=true \
  --cuda-graph-trace=node --delay 30 --duration 60 \
  python benchmarks/benchmark_serving.py \
  --backend vllm --model meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct \
  --dataset-name sharegpt --num-prompts 1000 --request-rate 10.0

# Analysis and statistics generation
nsys stats batch_profile.nsys-rep
```

**Performance pattern recognition enables targeted optimization.** Small models (7B parameters) exhibit memory-bound characteristics requiring GEMV kernel optimization for single requests and GEMM-SPLITK kernels for batch sizes 2-64. Large models (70B+ parameters) become compute-bound with larger batches, benefiting from multi-step scheduling that provides 28% throughput improvement.

**Production monitoring balances insight with overhead.** Implement essential metric collection focusing on Time to First Token (TTFT), Inter-Token Latency (ITL), GPU cache usage, and request queue depth. Set alert thresholds at 90% GPU cache usage, >100 waiting requests, P95 latency exceeding 2x baseline, and error rates above 1%.

## Hardware considerations and deployment strategies

**GPU architecture alignment maximizes optimization effectiveness.** H100 configurations benefit from FlashAttention-3 with WGMMA instructions and FP8 quantization support, achieving up to 75% GPU utilization. A100 deployments should leverage FlashAttention-2 with optimized tile sizes: INT8 multiples of 16, FP16 multiples of 8, TF32 multiples of 4.

**Network infrastructure impacts multi-node scaling.** InfiniBand HDR 200Gbps minimum provides necessary bandwidth for distributed inference, with RDMA-enabled networking and dedicated AI cluster fabric. Bandwidth overprovisioning at 2:1 ratio accommodates traffic bursts during collective operations.

**Storage optimization reduces model loading bottlenecks.** Configure NVMe Gen4 SSDs in RAID for sustained high-bandwidth model access. Implement prefetching of upcoming model layers during current layer computation, using POSIX memory mapping for framework compatibility.

## Implementation roadmap and recommendations

**Phase 1 optimizations provide immediate gains.** Upgrade to vLLM V1 for automatic 1.7x speedup, configure gpu_memory_utilization to 0.9+, set max_num_batched_tokens above 8096 for throughput workloads. These changes require minimal code modification while delivering substantial performance improvements.

**Phase 2 advanced configuration targets specific bottlenecks.** Implement tensor parallelism for large models, optimize batch sizing based on request patterns, monitor preemption rates for memory tuning. Configure attention kernels based on hardware capabilities and workload characteristics.

**Phase 3 scale-out optimization enables production deployment.** Deploy pipeline parallelism for multi-node setups, implement comprehensive monitoring and auto-scaling, optimize for specific hardware configurations with custom kernel integration.

The systematic application of these optimization techniques across framework, CUDA, system, and implementation layers enables production deployments to achieve **3-8x end-to-end performance improvements** while maintaining cost-effectiveness and operational reliability. Success requires understanding the interplay between optimization layers and implementing changes systematically based on profiling-driven insights rather than generic recommendations.
